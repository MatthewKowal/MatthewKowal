### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Matthew Kowal.
I am a PhD Candidate and researcher in the Chemistry Department of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. My current research interests are centered around computational optical microscopy for the visualization of single particles far below the diffraction limit. My goal is to build automated systems to facilitate the detection of nanoplastics.

Have a look at my published articles on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gWwZVDwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) profile.
